The aroma is complex, concentrated: currants, blackberries, a palette of oriental spices, graphite, coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco and leather notes. The body is dense, perfectly balanced. On the palate there are ripe black fruits, allspice, cloves and eucalyptus. Long-lasting enveloping aftertaste. Great wine, thanks to the master - winemaker!",

        "description": "Smells strong oak and dark fruit, but with a surprisingly obvious red plum and cheery flavor- an interesting combination not that typical of Cab in my mind. The succulence on the palate is such a bless to go with something like roast duck which is what I tried. The tannins on the finish feels smooth and tender. The finish is so compact that you won’t feel any unpleasant feelings afterwards but the cleanness and the comfortable dryness when you chew a pomegranate or a real grape!.",

        "description": "A robust Israeli Cab from vineyards in historic hills. Winemaker is the famous Amichai Luria who has great ideas on winemaking. The Cab is aged 15 months in French Oak. Strong nose of plum, pomegranate, green pepper, and zatar. Bouncy mouth of bing cherry, plum, petrol, and rocky hillside. Sharp tannins demand a good decant to tame a slightly astringent finish. Paired well with top rib by Mrs. L for Friday dinner. Not at the top of Israeli Cabs but a solid 3.6 from me. L’chaim my friends!!!",
